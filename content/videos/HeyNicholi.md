A tiny planet glimpse into the future of stereo visual entertainment.
Caught in a curious loop, our heroes once again blend the lines of virtual and reality.
Motion of words speaks emotion of voice for all to hear through seeing.
Immersive experiences accessible for all.

"Hey, Nicholi!" is an exploration into the future of expanded accessibility within virtual reality storytelling. The full project synopsis can be viewed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PGE-gn3tqwMRCdMErBNJKL-NPVPI3qnt/view?usp=sharing

While traditional closed captioning provides helpful audio transcription, reading text while processing abstract storyline and tone is mentally exhausting. Almost all of a programâ€™s emotional message is lost in translation to text, leaving those who rely on transcription to continually guess the context behind the words. I believe it is time for an upgrade, and virtual reality is the perfect opportunity. Using kinetic typography, each phrase comes alive to communicate both spoken word and emotional context. Providing enhanced storytelling, specially designed to include and honor all creative communities.
