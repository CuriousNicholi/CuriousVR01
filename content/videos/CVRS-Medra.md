On the very first (and longest) episode of CuriousVR Show, Medra drops by to discuss Creator Jam and the benefits of Creative Commons and Open Source, remixable content, and how it all fits into Neos VR and the Metaverse. Then we venture to Creator Jam's Wild West world to check out the saloon and secret "The Good and the Innocent" hideout made by Innocent Thief and GoodOldNervy.

Admittedly this is a bit of a long-winded video, but it's also meant to be a test and learning lesson. I figured out my mixed reality bedroom idea is really cool for about two seconds, then it gets boring. So from now on, I'll be spending a large majority, if not all, of the show exploring worlds, building stuff, and visiting new friends.

CuriousVR Show is the first, only, and certainly strangest stereoscopic mixed reality show in the entire Metaverse. Join CuriousVR as he explores virtual reality in NeosVR and discovers VR culture is alive and thriving. Each episode showcases an event or world and it's creator. Discussing philosophy, the future of collaboration, and everything happening in Neos VR. Documenting the growth of this phenomenon we call Metaverse. In stereoscopic 3D just like the real thing. Made in VR for VR about VR. 180VR to be precise.
