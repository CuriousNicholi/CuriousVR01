Testing testing 1-2-3! Welcome to the CuriousVR Show. I'm CuriousVR and this is my show... in stereo!
After months and months of hacks and tweaks, the big day is getting closer and closer. CuriousVR Show is coming at you in stereoscopic 3D mixed reality soon, and you don't want to admiss the adventure. So stay tuned and get ready to see the first, only, and certainly strangest 3D mixed reality talk show IN THE ENTIRE METAVERSE!!

Since YouTubeVR only works on Oculus Quest, I wanted to make sure all my VR friends and fans always have access to the content in true 3D no matter what platform they play. I'll always keep these playlists updated, so be sure to follow the link below, then click "Save Playlist" (the three lines and + sign icon below the video after the link) for updates any time I upload a new video.
