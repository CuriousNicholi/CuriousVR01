I publish all of my videos in VR180 stereoscopic and have found it challenging to share online as social media apps still haven't incorporated VR180 content into their platforms. Rather than get discouraged, this just made me more determined. My goal is to make shareable content with a captivating story that doesn't require sound, and is playable as a looped animated GIF to be shared in the most current format on any social media platform in both mono (2D) and stereo (3D). I chose YouTube as the primary outlet to highlight stereoscopic video in VR180 format. This means you can enjoy watching on your computer screen, gaze around the scene with your phone, and even strap on any VR headset (Google cardboard works great) to see how much more immersive this experience is in stereoscopic 3D.
My personal challenge was to produce the epic-est video I've ever made, and am super proud of the result. For the past year, I've spent all of my time either creating VR180 videos, or imagining what my next VR180 video will become.
All video and audio in this project was captured using a single Insta360 EVO. With very careful planning, meticulous organization, and especially creative camera placement all combined into an extremely challenging and equally rewarding Curiously Creative Epic Experience on the Tiniest of Tiny Planets: in 3D STEREOVISION!!
