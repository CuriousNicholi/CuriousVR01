After the official announcement at ~~Oculus~~ Facebook Connect last week, Quest 2 is the hot topic at every virtual watercooler this side of reality. We swoon over the new color and framerate, argue pixels and processors until we’re Facebook-blue in the face, and lament over controllers that are “OMG, like… so 2019.”


However, a genuine concern hides deeper than these conversations dive.
While [the consumer world complains](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03G77VHKzOj8JyAueqeXrqiVfHdig%3A1601998318087&source=hp&ei=7o18X6CBAo2itQXY5JDoCw&q=oculus+login+with+facebook&oq=oculus+login&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgBMgUIABDJAzIHCAAQFBCHAjICCAAyAggAMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeOgQIIxAnOgUIABCRAjoCCC46CAguEMcBEKMCOg0IABCxAxDJAxAUEIcCOg0IABCxAxCDARAUEIcCOggIABCxAxCDAToICC4QxwEQrwE6BQgAELEDOgoIABCxAxAUEIcCOggILhCxAxCDAToLCAAQsQMQyQMQkQI6BAgAEApQhRFY2x9gwkNoAHAAeACAAV2IAcEGkgECMTKYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab) about having to use their “Real Name” Facebook accounts to access the virtual world (i.e. Facebook Horizon), education has a very concerning adjacent issue to deal with: access and appropriation of student data.

A little background to bring you up to speed:
K-12 and university education systems have invested hundreds of thousands of your tax dollars and students’ tuition into virtual reality headsets that are mostly just sitting on shelves because administrators are afraid to use them. They were purchased by the dozen, expected to boot up a future of education through technological utopia. An idea initially sold as an all-encompassing solution to every organization’s fears of being left behind while this mysterious virtual reality grows so quickly life can’t keep up. It’s no coincidence the Go and Quest (both now deprecated) were each released just in time for fiscal year-end when all educational institutions predictably scramble to spend their remaining budget by mid-June.
Quest 2 follows the same pattern, only this year educators are scrambling to provide an immersive learning experience to students at home before remote classes ramp back up during the pandemic. Once again selling powerful tools with big solutions, but no real training to use them constructively.

Now back to the issue of logins.
Currently, universities implement a closed system for their student IDs. As a student, you log into the school’s dedicated system directly through their website. This is used to access assignments, email, grades, and private records strictly regulated by the federal government. For good reason.
In this closed system, every course, every message, every click can only be acquired by the school. No other entity has access. That system is closed down as the first and only point of entry into the school.

Of course, once in the school’s system, you can log into your social media profile and that site can gather all the data they want while you’re in their domain, but can’t see anything outside of that.
Now imagine the opposite. When you log into Facebook first (whether through their website or the Oculus headset), you are allowing them first access to your data. No, they can’t get your student records or financial information because that is all locked within the school’s domain, so that part is still protected. However, while they might not specifically collect students’ academic and financial records, they are collecting everything else. Your IP address. Your movements. Your gaze. What apps you like, how long you talked to your mom last week, and even how long you spent on your homework last night.


Do you consider this a security risk? or is it just part of the cost of technology?  
No matter what side of the fence you’re on, one thing is certain. Social media corporations are sneaky sneaky. They’ve mastered the art of using each and every one of us as tiny chess pieces in their quest for capturing as much data with as much detail as possible without us ever noticing. All to provide advertisers with the information they need to target you through identifiable traits and personalized marketing. Now venturing into the education sector.

**I'd like to hear what you think.**  
At what point does this cross the privacy line?  
Are federal regulations and [FERPA](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) prepared for social media’s next round of strategic advancement?
