Like many of you, Netflix’s [*Cobra Kai*](https://www.netflix.com/title/81002370) bit me hard on episode one. It’s literally the only television/film I’ve watched this year, and I watched all of it. It’s entertaining with plenty of nostalgia and captivating new characters. But what hits hardest is the core values taught by each competing sensei, and how accurately those lessons reach through the monitor and into every viewers’ own personal growth. Almost as if the show is in itself a sensei to Gen Z just like the original Karate Kid(s) were to Gen X. That’s meta done right. Today’s lesson/blog post combo move comes from Johnny Lawrence:  
**Stop moving forward and “You get stuck like cement.”**

Each of us has our own story, facing our own challenges, and we’re all fighting to push forward in our own way. None of us want to stop because we don’t want to get stuck.  
Especially not here. Definitely not now. This future is too possible to just sit and wait.

But how can you tell if you’re moving forward when there’s nothing around to use for reference? In the physical world, there are always reference points. Objects near and far changing position relative to our location. We use those surroundings as indicators of our own direction and speed. But what if there aren’t any objects to reference? What if the only thing around you is blank space? Or a bedroom and computer screen that look exactly the same everyday?  
Currently, that’s the precise challenge I am facing in life. Seems like a lot of us are. Amplified by the pandemic and quite a few months in isolation with only my own thoughts and memories, facing dreams and demons alike, I often can’t help wondering if I’m moving forward or even moving at all.

Imagine yourself as a jet flying in clear blue sky. No clouds. No ground in sight. Only the plane and sky. We know it is moving at 500+ miles per hour, but without reference to clouds the plane appears to be standing still. Just hovering without direction. That’s a lot like how this all feels right now. We see the horizon, feel the air flowing across our skin. But how much of that is progress versus just the wind blowing? Not to say we aren’t moving. It’s just a lot harder to tell lately. Yet we push on. In many ways, that's precisely what it means to be human.

But how do you make that happen? That's the big question, right?

That’s why I’m starting this blog. This whole site really. To reference my own movement. A way to visualize progress over time through regular checkpoints drawing a map to look back upon. Placing little clouds in the sky as markers to reference as I’m flying by.
